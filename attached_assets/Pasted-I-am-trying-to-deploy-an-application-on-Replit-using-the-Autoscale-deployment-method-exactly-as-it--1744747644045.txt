I am trying to deploy an application on Replit using the Autoscale deployment method, exactly as it is currently designed and functioning in the Replit development environment. The goal is to have a production-ready deployment that replicates the same design, features, and behavior of the current working app within Replit. However, the deployment fails and shows an error message when trying to access the app online.

I am very concerned because if this happens while the application is live with potential clients, it will severely affect the reliability and trustworthiness of the platform.

Here is the context and current configuration:

Deployment type: Autoscale

Error messages: See attached image from deployment error logs.

App size details:

Total size: 811MB

node_modules: 671MB (82.7%)

Source code (client, server, shared): ~2MB

Build and run commands:

In package.json:

dev: tsx server/index.ts

build: vite build && esbuild server/index.ts --platform=node --packages=external --bundle --format=esm --outdir=dist

start: NODE_ENV=production node dist/index.js

In .replit:

Build command: npm run build

Run command: node server.js (handles Replit health checks)

Ports configuration:

Main port: 3000 (externally mapped to 3000)

Internal app port: 5017 (mapped to 3001)

Others: 5000 (to 80), 8080 (to 8080)

Environment variables: All are correctly defined in the "Deployments > Secrets" section, including:

DATABASE_URL, OPENAI_API_KEY, STRIPE_SECRET_KEY, VITE_STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY,

AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY, AWS_REGION,

GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID, GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET

Listening address: Both the main server (server.js) and the app server (server/index.ts) are set to listen on 0.0.0.0.

I want you to do the following:

Research deeply across my codebase

Find what files and functions are related to the problems and goals I outlined above

Assess reasons for why the deployment might not be working or why it might not work as expected

If this is a limitation of the platform or a mistake in configuration, tell me clearly

Develop a plan to fix it

Write this entire plan and report into a file called "Instructions.md" in my project
